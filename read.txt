## Other AB includes also diagnoses with doubt of AB treatments
## tSCC disregared for now (future study - IMI cutoff ? More stable models)
## other AB treatments is only in the dryoff period - should daysi prior dryoff be included?
## CNS: Should this be a major? Even though limit for treat is <32; individual coloumn?
## Major: four pahtogens included - more?
## SCC: more than just the last and first SCC measure? average of two? (create 2 new coloumns)
## loosing a lot of obs with: 
# df8 <- df8 %>% 
#  filter(DRYTREAT_DATE < CALVING_DATE |is.na(DRYTREAT_DATE)) %>%
#  filter(DRYTREAT_DATE >= DRYOFF_DATE |is.na(DRYTREAT_DATE))

#---------------------------------------
# To Do

## PCR_report: Based on PCR_dryoff script
## PCR_dryoff: Based on PCR (pcr, pcr_all), Treatments (teat, other, dryoff), dryoff date, calving outcome, calving date. 150 days prior calving. Not production

## PCR_test1: double randomized
## PCR_test2: Group final data by parity=2, breed=holstein. Choose max 1000 observations

## include previous lactation length
## Take the two first SCC and two last instead of only the first..

## test how treatments should be added. We now have three treatment scripts; dry, teat, other
# dry + vetpcr should still be merged
# teat + other merging afterwards?

#-----------------------------------------
# overview of scripts

# 1: PCR_clean: Load and basic cleaning raw data
# 2: PCR_prepare: Steps between clean & merge; selecting PCR & teatment data
# 3: PCR_merge: Merging scripts to full final data
# 4: PCR_descriptive: Descriptive analysis & population description on full data
# 5: PCR_visualizing: Visualizing full data and variables of interest
# 6: PCR_analysis: glm, lm and stan_glm on full data
# 7: PCR_jags: Initial model testing
# 8: PCR_test1: Double randomized test data from full data; max 1000 observations
# 9: PCR_test2: Test data from full data: 5-6 herds; eco + con; Holstein; Parity 2
# 10: PCR_dryoff: Include all tests and treatments 150 days prior calving + descriptives
# 11: PCR_misc: Misc tests & analysis
# 12: PCR_teat: to be deleted: Include the teat treatments in _prepare
# 13: PCR_report: R for PCR_report.Rmd (load PCR_prepare and PCR_merge)
